# ImageDuplicator

:slightly_frowning_face: **Problem in the system-as-is** 

When a friend sends a Whatsapp image and then deletes it, the image is deleted from the phone's gallery. this problem is only present in andriod devices

:slightly_smiling_face: **solution in the system-to-be**

ImageDuplicator listens to the directory where Whatsapp images are created and then duplicates the image in a new folder.
